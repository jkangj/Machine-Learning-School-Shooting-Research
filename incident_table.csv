Officers on traffic detail found “multiple victims.” Acting Police Chief Rick Edwards says a total of seven people were shot. A family spokesperson confirmed An 18-year-old Shawn Jackson and his 36-year-old father, Renzo Smith, died as a result of their injuries. A 31-year-old is suffering from life-threatening injuries. Edwards also confirmed four other males, ages 14, 42, 55 and 58, were injured but are expected to be okay. Six other people sustained injuries unrelated to the gunfire, three reported needing to be transported to the hospital for anxiety, two were injured from falls and a 9-year-old was hit by a car as they were running away from the area. That child is also expected to be okay. Police have a 19-year-old man in custody that they believe was involved in the shooting. He is expected to be charged with two counts of second-degree murder with more potential charges. Police also think the suspect knew at least one of the victims. Richmond Public Schools confirmed the shooting happened outside the theater after Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony and occurred in Monroe Park adjacent to the theater. The district says they have canceled all high school graduation ceremonies this week. Richmond Police said there were four total guns recovered from the shooting scene near Monroe Park at North Laurel and West Main Street. Police said Pollard had one gun, police confirmed. Another person, not directly involved in the shooting and who never fired gunshots, was found with the second gun, police said. Police have not yet said to whom the remaining two guns belonged.

Jackson-Smith told 8News she witnessed a teen boy run up behind her son and open fire. “My son was walking toward me, and I seen the boy run up behind him and just start shooting him from behind,” she said. “My son was walking toward me. My husband was walking behind my son, but somehow the boy ran around everybody and ran behind my son.” Shawn Jackson and his stepfather, Renzo Smith, were shot dead. Several other people were shot and injured. Police later identified the gunman as 19-year-old Amari Pollard, adding that the victim and suspect knew each other and had an “ongoing dispute.” Jackson-Smith said she was unclear on what the dispute was about but confirmed the two knew each other. “They were friends. He used to stay at my house when they were little kids since they were like 8 years old,” she said. “My son told me, about four-five months ago, that he was going to see him, so I didn’t even know that they were having a problem. When you think of people that your child considered a friend… and somebody stayed in your home… you wouldn’t think that they would be that angry at you that they would take their life from you.

Brewer High School at around 8:28 a.m. on May 21, 1985. That vehicle eventually left the area, but Biles noticed the vehicle again at around 1:16 p.m. Four minutes later, Deputy Biles radioed in, stating he had been shot and needed assistance. He had reportedly approached the driver’s side of the suspicious vehicle to ask for their ID when he saw the barrel of a semi-automatic rifle. While trying to push the barrel of the gun away from his head and toward the driver, authorities say Biles heard a click. “As he reached for the barrel, he heard a “click” but did not know if it was the safety or the hammer on the weapon. Just as he touched the barrel, he heard the weapon fire and felt his chest burn,” the MCSO said in their post remembering Biles. The vehicle was driving away, but not before it is said Deputy Biles got a few shots in and even hit the suspect’s gas tank, causing him to run out of gas in Cullman County. Cullman County authorities were notified by a couple who had been listening to scanners that the out-of-gas vehicle was at Hebron Church. A Cullman County Deputy and a Blount County Deputy approached the car and the suspect, directing them to throw the weapon and exit the car. It was reported that the suspect was a minor and former Brewer High student armed with a semi-automatic rifle, two rifle clips, 372 rounds of ammunition and a knife and dealing with mental health issues.
